  # small thing but this is not properly indented
  %br
  # also, why are you using br's instead of padding top?
  # e.g., remove the br's and have something like
  # #footer{:style => 'padding-top: 20px;'}
  # Lastly, I go with HTML5 in new development and so instead of a div with ID footer
  # I just use the footer element (i.e., %footer).
